# name-generator
This is a project similar to my [previous](https://github.com/santitomatis/rememberable-password-generator) (just a password generator) but instead of a password now generates a name that could hypothetically be used to create a bot's name maybe for a videogame or similar.

### Disclaimer
**Please be aware that as [mentioned later on](https://github.com/santitomatis/rememberable-password-generator#what-i-learned), this is just a project made to help me learn some python, even doe it does work, it could have some mistakes and also it may be noticeable *specially if you generate a lot of names* **
